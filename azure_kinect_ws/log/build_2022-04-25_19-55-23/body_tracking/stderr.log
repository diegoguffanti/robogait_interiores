CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:47 (add_executable):
  Target "prueba_talker" links to target "body_tracking::hip_coordinates" but
  the target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an
  IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
