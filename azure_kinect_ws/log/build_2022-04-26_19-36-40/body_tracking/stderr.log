CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findkinect.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "kinect", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "kinect" with any
  of the following names:

    kinectConfig.cmake
    kinect-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "kinect" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "kinect_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "kinect"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
