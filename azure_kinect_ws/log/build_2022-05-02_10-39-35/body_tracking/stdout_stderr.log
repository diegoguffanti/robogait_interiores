CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (include):
  include could not find load file:

    ../body_tracker_msgs/msg


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbody_tracker_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "body_tracker_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "body_tracker_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    body_tracker_msgsConfig.cmake
    body_tracker_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "body_tracker_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "body_tracker_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "body_tracker_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
