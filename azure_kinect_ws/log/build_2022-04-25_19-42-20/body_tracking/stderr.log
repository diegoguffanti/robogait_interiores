CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbody_tracking::hip_coordinates.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "body_tracking::hip_coordinates", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "body_tracking::hip_coordinates" with any of the following names:

    body_tracking::hip_coordinatesConfig.cmake
    body_tracking::hip_coordinates-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "body_tracking::hip_coordinates" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "body_tracking::hip_coordinates_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "body_tracking::hip_coordinates" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
