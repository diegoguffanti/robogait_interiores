CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findk4a_ROOT.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "k4a_ROOT",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "k4a_ROOT" with any
  of the following names:

    k4a_ROOTConfig.cmake
    k4a_root-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "k4a_ROOT" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "k4a_ROOT_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "k4a_ROOT" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
